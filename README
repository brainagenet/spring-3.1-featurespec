For those familiar with Git:

    git clone git@github.com:cbeams/spring-3.1-profiles-xml.git

Or if you prefer using Subversion:

    svn co http://svn.github.com/cbeams/spring-3.1-profiles-xml.git spring-3.1-profiles-xml.git

Once checked out, you can build from the command line using either Gradle or
Maven.  If you're new to Gradle, don't worry -- there's nothing for you to
install.  Simply type the following within the root directory of the project:

    >$ ./gradlew build

If necessary, this 'Gradle wrapper' script will download a distribution of
Gradle for you.  If you prefer Maven, of course you can simply type:

    >$ mvn test

If you're using an IDE that supports Maven-based projects, you can of course
import the project directly from its POM.  In any case, if you're using Eclipse
you can generate Eclipse project metadata with

    >$ ./gradlew eclipse

IDEA users can do the same with

    >$ ./gradlew idea
